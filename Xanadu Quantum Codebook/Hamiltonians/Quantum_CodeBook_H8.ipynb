        "We've seen two different ways to simulate physical systems in this module so far: Trotterization, and linear combination of unitaries (LCU). Which should you use? It turns out that each method works better in certain situations. Both are useful tools for the toolbox of the quantum physicist! To understand when to use LCU and when to use Trotterization, we'll look at how the simulation cost for a given error depends on the Hamiltonian at hand."
