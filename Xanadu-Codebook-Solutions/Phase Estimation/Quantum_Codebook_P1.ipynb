        "In this module we are going to learn about an algorithm that helps us estimate the eigenvalue of a given unitary operator. The eigenvectors of a unitary operator form an orthonormal basis set. Applying the unitary operator on one of its eigenvectors multiplies it by a global phase (the eigenvalue). For unitary operators, the eigenvalues have magnitude  and can be written in the form , where  is called the eigenphase corresponding to the eigenvalue.\n",

Instead, we can use the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm which, given an eigenvector of a unitary matrix, finds the corresponding eigenvalue. To start building up this algorithm, we begin implementing the phase kickback."
