    "Since qubit states are represented with vectors, the way to manipulate them is through matrix multiplications, which transforms a vector into a different vector. Such matrix operations applied onto the states are called \"gates\". In quantum mechanics, matrices representing gates are required to be unitary (see _Math insert - unitary, adjoint or Hermitian conjugate_ ). This is to ensure normalization condition, i.e. probabilities add up to 1, mentioned in Section 1.1. Unitarity also constraints the operation to be reversible. This is intuitive as one can find an operation that reverts the gate and returns a system back to its original state.\n",

    "Let's introduce a commonly used gate, CNOT. One may know that NOT gate in classical computing is an operation that flips 0s and 1s. The CNOT gate acts on a two-qubit state. The two-qubit states is represented by a four-element vector, with the first qubit represented by the first two elements of the vector, and the second qubit by the last two elements. A CNOT gate flips the second qubit based on the state of the first qubit. Thus, the first qubit is called the \"control\" qubit, while the second one is called the \"target\" qubit. The CNOT gate takes the form of a 4 x 4 matrix.\n",

    "One can see that the first quadrant is a 2 x 2 identity matrix. It keeps the control qubit intact after\n",
    "multiplication. The fourth quadrant is the 2 x 2 NOT gate. It flips the target qubit from \"0\" to be \"1\" and\n",
    "from \"1\" to be \"0\" if the control qubit is \"1\" but does nothing if the control qubit is \"0\". Here's an example\n",

    "\n",
    "Measurements are different from gates. Gates are unitary which makes operations reversible. Gates acting upon a quantum system do not destroy the system or make connections between the system and the outside world. Applying a gate does not lose information. However, when we in the outside world want to obtain information from the system, we need to measure it. Measuring a system brings it into contact with the outside world, irrevocably destroying information. Thus, measurement is, in general, not reversible – the system cannot be brought back to its state before the measurement. One consequence of this difference is that a measurement cannot be executed by a gate. It is an interaction between the system and its environment. A parameter or physical variable measured from a quantum system is called an \"observable\" (because we can observe it). Momentum, mass, velocity and energy are all observables.\n",

    "In the end of session 1.1, we introduced a generalized probability theory. The key is that probability is equal to the _square of magnitude of amplitude_, so the square of amplitude must be a positive number between 0 and 1. Here, we're going to look at the idea of interference between different possibilities, which is something that is typical of quantum mechanics, but not of classical probability theory. Interference occurs because we use amplitudes, rather than probabilities, and amplitudes can be negative or complex. Let's use a metaphorical example to illustrate this abstract idea.\n",
