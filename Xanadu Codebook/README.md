<h1 align="center">XANADU QUANTUM CODEBOOK </h1>

## Introduction

The Xanadu Quantum Codebook was written, developed, and reviewed by members of the Xanadu team.

This resource will help you learn quantum computing by using Xanadu's quantum software framework PennyLane..


## What is the Xanadu Quantum Codebook?

The Codebook is an experimental, exercise-based introduction to quantum computing. Rather than just reading a textbook or tutorial, or executing some pre-written code cells, the Codebook is an active learning resource in which you will learn by doing.


## Is the Codebook for me?
This resource is intended for people who:

1. know how to program in Python and use numpy
2. know some basic linear algebra
3. You do not need to know any physics or quantum computing!

Below we list the specific concepts you should be familiar with.


## Python
1. basic control flow (for, if, while, etc.)
2. basic NumPy usage (creating arrays, adding/subtracting/multiplying arrays, manipulating them; the NumPy documentation is the best resource for this)
3. decorators
4. conceptual knowledge of functional programming is beneficial, but not a requirement
5. Familiarity with PennyLane is not required, and will be taught by this resource.


## Linear algebra
1. vectors
2. matrices
3. complex numbers (in both rectangular and polar form)
4. eigenvalues/eigenvectors
5. linear combinations
6. inner products
7. matrix exponentials
8. Cartesian and polar coordinates


## A few other mathematical concepts that will be useful are

1. basic trigonometry
2. basic probability theory (probability, conditional probability, and marginal probability)
3. Khan Academy is an excellent resource for learning about the above. Interactive Linear Algebra is also another great option.

## How do I use the Codebook?
The content is divided up into a graph of modules, each containing a graph of multiple nodes, like this one. (Note: modules are sometimes referred to as chapters, and nodes as sections). The main screen provides three panels: a graph view, coding challenges (codercises), and the textbook content.
